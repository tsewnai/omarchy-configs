## Design Philosophy: Mountain Serenity

This theme uses a **cool/warm complementary split** color theory:
- **Cool Foundation**: Slate grays and mountain blues evoke stone ridges and morning mist
- **Warm Accents**: Sunrise gold and autumn clay bring warmth and natural beauty
- **Balance**: Mountain streams and forest greens bridge the cool and warm tones
- **Sacred Moments**: Temple gold marks breakthrough insights and important elements

The result is a serene yet vibrant environment that promotes contemplation while maintaining clarity.
